# Computational-Biology
I want to maintain my skills in Bioinformatics and in Computational Biology. I am applying my knowledge and skills
to the data I used for my thesis and data I encountered in courses I took on edx.org and on coursera. My Python practice related to
Bioinformatics and to Computational Biology is included in this repository as well.
